## About this project

1. **Habit Creation**: It will allow you to create a habit that you want to track ... It could have a title, description, and category (health, productivity, etc.).
2. **Progress and Streak Tracking**: It will allow you to track your progress and streaks for each habit. You can mark a habit as done for a day, and it will keep track of your progress and streaks. It will visualize your progress and streaks in a calendar view.
3. **Reminders**: It will send you a reminder notification for any habit, in which the timing can be configured in the app.
